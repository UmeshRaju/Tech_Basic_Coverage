# **Phase 1: Fundamentals of Queues**
**Concepts to Cover**
- What is a Queue? (FIFO principle, basics)
- Roles of Producer, Consumer, and Broker.
- Advantages of decoupling services with queues.

**Practice Tasks**  
âœ… List real-world applications of queues (e.g., ride-hailing apps, food delivery).  
âœ… Build a basic in-memory queue system in your preferred language (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.).

---

# **Phase 2: Event-Driven Architecture Basics**
**Concepts to Cover**
- What is Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)?
- Event Producers, Event Consumers, Event Brokers.
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication.
- Push vs Pull models for message consumption.

**Practice Tasks**  
âœ… Identify real-world examples that became better with EDA (e.g., Uber surge pricing system).  
âœ… Build a mini event-driven simulation: e.g., order placed âž” inventory updated asynchronously.

---

# **Phase 3: RabbitMQ Fundamentals**
**Concepts to Cover**
- Introduction to RabbitMQ.
- Exchanges, Queues, and Bindings.
- Direct, Fanout, Topic, and Headers Exchanges.
- Message Acknowledgement and Delivery Guarantees (at least once).

**Practice Tasks**  
âœ… Install RabbitMQ locally using Docker.  
âœ… Create a Producer and Consumer that communicate via a RabbitMQ Direct Exchange.  
âœ… Test message acknowledgment and failure scenarios.

---

# **Phase 4: Kafka Fundamentals**
**Concepts to Cover**
- Introduction to Apache Kafka.
- Topics, Partitions, Brokers, Producers, and Consumers.
- Consumer Groups and Parallel Processing.
- Kafkaâ€™s durability guarantees.

**Practice Tasks**  
âœ… Install Kafka locally (Docker Compose setup).  
âœ… Create a Producer and Consumer that publish/subscribe to a Kafka Topic.  
âœ… Observe message consumption across multiple consumers (Consumer Group behavior).

---

# **Phase 5: Visibility Timeout, DLQs, and Redrives in RabbitMQ and Kafka**
**Concepts to Cover**
- **RabbitMQ**: TTL (Time-To-Live) for messages, Dead Letter Exchanges (DLX).
- **Kafka**: Retention Periods, Consumer Offsets, and Error Handling.
- Redrive concepts (retrying failed messages safely).

**Practice Tasks**  
âœ… Set up a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) in RabbitMQ with TTL and DLX.  
âœ… Simulate a consumer crash and observe Kafka's rebalancing behavior.  
âœ… Implement retry logic for message failures in both RabbitMQ and Kafka.

---

# **Phase 6: Reliability, Idempotency, and Monitoring**
**Concepts to Cover**
- Building idempotent Consumers (processing the same message safely multiple times).
- Monitoring RabbitMQ (RabbitMQ Management Plugin) and Kafka (JMX Metrics, Prometheus Exporters).
- Scaling Consumers and Handling Load.

**Practice Tasks**  
âœ… Implement an idempotent consumer (no duplicate orders created).  
âœ… Set up basic monitoring for RabbitMQ queues and Kafka topics.  
âœ… Stress-test your queue system and monitor metrics like message rates and consumer lag.

---

# **Phase 7: Real-World Simulation Project**
**Mini Project: Order Processing System**
- A user places an order.
- Order events are published to a queue/topic.
- Multiple services (Inventory, Shipping, Billing) consume the event asynchronously.

**Tools/Stack**
- RabbitMQ or Kafka (your choice).
- Backend service (Node.js, Python, or Java) for Producers and Consumers.
- Optional: Basic dashboard to visualize event flow.

**Practice Tasks**  
âœ… Implement producer and multiple consumers (Inventory, Shipping, Billing).  
âœ… Simulate different failure scenarios and validate DLQ handling.  
âœ… Monitor end-to-end event flow from order placement to fulfillment.
