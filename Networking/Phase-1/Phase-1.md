# 🧠 Introduction to Networking, TCP, and UDP

Welcome! This guide gives you a **very basic understanding of networking**, the key differences between **TCP** and **UDP**, and real-world applications of each. If you're new to networking, start here!

## 🌐 What is Networking?

**Networking** is the process of connecting computers and devices so they can **communicate and share information**. It allows emails to be sent, web pages to load, games to be played online, and much more.

At its core, networking is just devices talking to each other over cables or wireless signals using **rules called protocols**.

## 📦 What is TCP?

**TCP** stands for **Transmission Control Protocol**. It’s one of the main protocols of the Internet and is used for **reliable communication**.

### ✅ TCP Features:
- **Connection-oriented:** Establishes a connection before transferring data.
- **Reliable:** Ensures all data is received and acknowledged.
- **Ordered:** Delivers packets in the same order they were sent.
- **Error-checked:** Detects errors and re-sends lost packets.

### 🔁 How TCP Ensures Reliability:
- **3-way handshake:** 
  1. Client sends `SYN`
  2. Server replies with `SYN-ACK`
  3. Client sends `ACK`
- **ACKs (Acknowledgements):** The receiver confirms each packet.
- **Retransmissions:** If packets are lost, they are re-sent automatically.

## 📦 What is UDP?

**UDP** stands for **User Datagram Protocol**. It’s a simpler, faster way to send messages but **doesn't guarantee delivery or order**.

### 🚀 UDP Features:
- **Connectionless:** No handshake, just send and forget.
- **Faster:** Less overhead, great for real-time communication.
- **No ordering guarantee:** Packets may arrive out of order or not at all.
- **No error recovery:** Application must handle data loss.

## 🌍 Real-World Examples

| Application              | Protocol Used |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| Web Browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)| TCP           |
| Video Calls (Zoom, Meet) | UDP           |
| File Transfers (FTP)     | TCP           |
| Online Gaming            | UDP           |
| Email (SMTP, IMAP)       | TCP           |
| DNS Lookup               | UDP           |

## 🔁 Why Use UDP?

Apps like **video streaming** or **online games** prioritize **speed over reliability**. For example:
- In a video call, it's better to miss a frame than to wait and cause lag.
- In games, position updates are sent frequently — missing one is okay if the next one is fast.

## 📝 Practice Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: TCP vs UDP Comparison Table

| Feature                | TCP                              | UDP                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Type                   | Connection-oriented              | Connectionless                 |
| Reliability            | High (acknowledgements, retry)   | None (no retries or ACKs)      |
| Ordering               | Guaranteed                       | Not guaranteed                 |
| Speed                  | Slower (more overhead)           | Faster (minimal overhead)      |
| Use Case Examples      | Web, Email, File Transfer        | Gaming, Video, DNS             |
| Error Checking         | Yes                              | Optional                       |
| Setup Cost             | 3-way handshake                  | None                           |

### ✅ Task 2: Daily Apps & Protocol Mapping

Think about the apps you use every day and classify them:

| App / Service        | Likely Protocol | Why?                                           |
|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| WhatsApp Messages    | TCP              | Ensures messages are delivered and ordered     |
| WhatsApp Calls       | UDP              | Real-time audio prefers speed over reliability |
| Chrome (web browser) | TCP              | Websites need complete and ordered data        |
| Spotify Streaming    | UDP              | Tolerates some data loss to avoid buffering    |
| Gmail (email)        | TCP              | Emails must be delivered reliably              |

🎯 **Challenge:** Try writing a TCP or UDP client-server pair in Python. Can you send messages between them? Can you simulate packet loss in UDP?
