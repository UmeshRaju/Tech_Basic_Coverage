# **Phase 1: TCP vs UDP Fundamentals**
**Concepts to Cover**
- What is Networking? (Very basic)
- What is TCP? Features: connection-oriented, reliable, ordered.
- What is UDP? Features: connectionless, faster, no ordering guarantee.
- Real-world examples where TCP and UDP are used.
- How TCP ensures reliability (3-way handshake, ACKs).
- Why some apps prefer UDP (games, video streaming).

**Practice Tasks**  
âœ… Create a table comparing TCP and UDP.  
âœ… List 5 applications you use daily and identify if they use TCP or UDP.

# **Phase 2: OSI and TCP/IP Layers**
**Concepts to Cover**
- What is the OSI Model? (7 layers)
- What is the TCP/IP Model? (4 layers)
- Where do TCP/UDP fit in the models? (Transport Layer)
- Where does gRPC fit? (Application Layer over HTTP/2)
- Layer-wise responsibility examples:
  - Data Link: MAC addresses
  - Network: IP addressing
  - Transport: TCP/UDP
  - Application: HTTP, gRPC, DNS

**Practice Tasks**  
âœ… Draw a small OSI model and map real-world protocols at each layer.  
âœ… Understand simple packet flow: when you send a WhatsApp message, what happens layer by layer?

# **Phase 3: gRPC Deep Dive**
**Concepts to Cover**
- What is RPC (Remote Procedure Call)?
- What is gRPC? Why is it used instead of REST?
- How gRPC uses HTTP/2 under the hood.
- Concepts of Protobufs (Protocol Buffers).
- Unary, Server Streaming, Client Streaming, Bidirectional Streaming in gRPC.
- Authentication and Security in gRPC.

**Practice Tasks**  
âœ… Install gRPC in a basic Node.js, Go, or Python project.  
âœ… Create a simple gRPC service and client that talks over localhost.  
âœ… Implement a basic server-streaming gRPC example (like streaming logs).

---

# **Phase 4: Real-World Applications**
**Concepts to Cover**
- How big companies use gRPC internally (Google, Netflix, etc.).
- When to choose TCP vs UDP in your system designs.
- When to use gRPC vs REST API vs WebSocket.
- Where Layer awareness is important in DevOps and System Design.

**Practice Tasks**  
âœ… Design a system where some parts use TCP and some parts use UDP.  
âœ… Write a sample network flow for a microservices system using gRPC for internal communication.

# **ðŸŒŸ Bonus (Optional Advanced)**
- Learn about QUIC (HTTP/3) and how it combines TCP+TLS+UDP ideas.
- gRPC-Web: Using gRPC in browsers via HTTP/1.1 fallback.
- OpenTelemetry and Distributed Tracing over gRPC services.
