### **Phase 2: Intermediate JavaScript**

#### **Key Differences in JavaScript Concepts**

### **Objects & Methods**
| Concept               | Key Difference |
|----------------------|---------------|
| **Objects vs. Arrays** | Objects store key-value pairs, arrays store ordered elements. |
| **Object vs. Map** | Objects have fixed keys, while Maps allow any data type as keys with better performance for frequent additions/removals. |
| **Method vs. Function** | Methods are functions inside objects, functions are standalone. |
| **this in Objects vs. Arrow Functions** | `this` in objects refers to the calling object, while in arrow functions, it inherits from the surrounding scope. |

### **Array Methods**
| Method               | Key Difference |
|----------------------|---------------|
| **map vs. filter vs. reduce** | `map` transforms elements, `filter` returns matching elements, `reduce` accumulates values into one result. |
| **forEach vs. map** | `forEach` executes a function on each element (no return), `map` returns a new array. |
| **find vs. some vs. every** | `find` returns first match, `some` checks if any element meets condition, `every` checks all elements. |

### **Variable & Operator Differences**
| Concept           | Key Difference |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Spread vs. Rest (`...`)** | Spread expands elements; Rest collects multiple values into an array. |
| **Destructuring vs. Spread vs. Rest** | Destructuring extracts values from arrays/objects; Spread expands elements into a new array/object; Rest gathers remaining elements into an array. |

### **Asynchronous JavaScript**
| Concept          | Key Difference |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Callback vs. Promise** | Callbacks are functions passed as arguments; Promises handle async operations more cleanly. |
| **Promise vs. Async/Await** | Promises use `.then()`, while `async/await` makes async code look synchronous. |

### **Error Handling**
| Concept          | Key Difference |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **try-catch vs. throw** | `try-catch` handles errors, `throw` generates custom errors. |
