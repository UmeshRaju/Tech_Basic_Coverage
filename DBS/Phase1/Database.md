# What is a Database?

A **database** is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data. Databases are the backbone of nearly all modern applicationsâ€”from banking systems to social media platforms.

## Structured vs Unstructured Data

### Structured Data
- Organized in a predefined schema (rows and columns)
- Easily searchable using SQL
- Examples:
  - Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL
  - Tables containing customer data: name, email, age

### Unstructured Data
- No predefined schema or structure
- Typically text-heavy or multimedia content
- Harder to query using traditional methods
- Examples:
  - Emails, videos, social media posts
  - NoSQL databases like MongoDB or data lakes

| Feature              | Structured Data              | Unstructured Data           |
|----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Format               | Predefined schema             | No predefined format        |
| Storage              | Relational databases          | NoSQL/Flat files            |
| Query Language       | SQL                           | Custom/Document-based       |
| Example              | Customer table in MySQL       | Tweets stored in JSON files |

## Why Databases Matter

- Enable **data integrity** and **consistency**
- Support **concurrent access** by multiple users
- Allow for **backup, replication**, and **fault tolerance**
- Power modern systems like e-commerce platforms, finance apps, content management systems, and more
