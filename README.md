## 📂 Folder Structure & Purpose

Each folder in this repository represents a fundamental area of technology, subdivided into phases and topics for progressive learning:

| Folder            | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DBS/`            | Core Database Systems concepts, normalization, indexing, query design, and more. |
| `Frontend/`       | HTML, CSS, JS, and modern frontend ecosystem essentials.                         |
| `Networking/`     | OSI model, protocols, IP addressing, and practical networking tasks.             |
| `Nodejs/`         | Node.js basics to advanced backend concepts using Express and beyond.            |
| `Python_Backend/` | Flask/Django and other backend patterns with Python.                             |
| `Queues/`         | Algorithmic concepts related to queues and implementations.                      |

> Each folder contains relevant **code samples**, **explanatory notes**, **`Readme.md`** for the plan and **`Phase.md`** files for phased progression.

## 📌 What is `Readme.md`?
* Organises the plan and number of phases we have to go through to learn the topic/concept.
  
## 📌 What is `Phase.md`?

Each folder contains a `Phase.md` file that:

* Lists **core topics** in a progressive order (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → ...).
* Helps you **revisit** or **revise** the concepts quickly.
* Works like a **checklist** for tracking your learning progress.

These phase files are great for revision during interviews or regular skill sharpening.
